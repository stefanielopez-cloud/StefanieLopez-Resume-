        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Experienced in the fields of finance, marketing, and business management. Recently graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a bachelorâ€™s in finance and a minor in marketing. Currently seeking to gain more experience in these fields. Have gotten internships with name companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Help create templates for social media outlets, as well as promote different ads. Was able to obtain paid internships with social media influencers, as well as, share my ideas to help grow their platform. Became part of many non-profit organizations to expand my network and socialize with like-minded people. As well as share my opinions with others who had a different view, and was able to effectively communicate our ideas to come into an agreement. Was able to gain experience by connecting with others, and sharing ideas. By joining different non-profits organizations I was able to develop my communication skills, as well as, project management skills. I was able to secure different high position sports within these organizations. Such as becoming project management for events, and well as a budget management woman. I have also been able to secure a spot in working with other international businesses. Have been able to work for their companies and help gain knowledge on how to sustain my business. <br><br>

        As a business owner, I operate my own and manage my small company. I handle responsibilities such as creating business plans, arranging to finance, hiring staff, reviewing sales, developing marketing strategies, overseeing daily activities, and identifying business opportunities. I believe successful example resumes for Business Owner showcase the following assets: business acumen, creativity, leadership, managerial skills, networking, communication and interpersonal skills, and computer competencies. Furthermore, most resumes should make a display of a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and training in business, although a formal education is not compulsory for this role. I have learned this through my internships, non-profit organizations, and job experiences. It has taught me how to manage and sustain a small business that could eventually turn into a multi-dollar business. By being able to become part of your team I will have the opportunity to expand my knowledge as well as gain other efficient skills. I will bring all my skills, and creative thinking skills to help grow this company. 
<br><br>

Relationship builder and connector in the field of small business and women's entrepreneurship.

A start-up environment created tools, templates, and proposals to identify, hire, and train market leaders to connect women's enterprises with increased economic opportunities in Africa, Europe, Latin America, Japan,  and Australia.
